# Docker Minecraft Server

A simple docker image to run a minecraft server in a docker container.
Downloads the desired minecraft version on startup and automatically launches it.
You can mount `/mc/server` as a volume in your host machine to persist data across container launches.


## Building the image

### From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DarthChungo/docker-minecraft-server.git
cd docker-minecraft-server
```

```bash
docker build -t darthchungo/docker-minecraft-server:latest .
```

### From docker hub

Alternatively, you can download a prebuilt image from docker hub:

```bash
docker pull darthchungo/docker-minecraft-server:latest
```


## Running the image

Now create a directory to store the server data, like `data`, and run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 25565:25565 -v $(pwd)/data:/mc/server darthchungo/docker-minecraft-server:latest
```


## Running commands

To run a command inside the container, use:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> cmd <command>
```

Where `<container_id>` is the docker container id (use `docker container ls`), and `<command>` is the command.
If `<command>` is left empty, it will drop you into an interactive shell, provided you keep the `-it` flags.
You may also choose to modify the image to expose port `25575` and connect to it through RCON directly with the default password, `rconpass`.


## Configuration

Configuration is handled through the docker environment.
Currently used arguments:
- `SERVER_TYPE`: server flavour, use `vanilla`, `fabric` or `forge`
- `SERVER_VERSION`: available options vary depending on flavour:
  - `vanilla` and `fabric`:
    - `latest`: for latest release
    - `latest-snapshot`: for latest snapshot
    - `<version_number>`: for a specific version number (including snapshots)
  - `forge`:
    - `latest`: for latest published forge version
    - `latest-recommended`: for latest recommended forge version
    - `<version_number>-latest`: latest forge version for a certain minecraft version
    - `<version_number>-recommended` or `<version_number>`: latest recommended forge version for a certain minecraft version
- `SERVER_CUSTOM_URL`: a custom URL to download the server from. Bypasses `SERVER_VERSION` if used. Remember to set `SERVER_VERSION` when using this option regardless, as it is used when invoking the server (use `vanilla` for a typical jar file).

_Note: forge does not provide snapshot builds._
