# Docker Minecraft Server

A simple docker image to run a minecraft server in a docker container.
Automatically downloads the minecraft server jar from the desired link and runs it.
You can mount `/mc/server` as a volume in your host machine to persist data across container launches.


## Building the image

### From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DarthChungo/docker-minecraft-server.git
cd docker-minecraft-server
```

```bash
docker build -t darthchungo/docker-minecraft-server:latest .
```

### From docker hub

Alternatively, you can download a prebuilt image from docker hub:

```bash
docker pull darthchungo/docker-minecraft-server:latest
```


## Running the image

Now create a directory to store the server data, like `data`, and run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 25565:25565 -v $(pwd)/data:/mc/server darthchungo/docker-minecraft-server:latest
```
